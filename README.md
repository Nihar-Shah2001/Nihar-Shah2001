 ## Current Research
 I am currently working on _Solving Large Scale Sparse Matrix Non - linear Eigen Value Problems_ which generally arise in **DFT-FE** using _Quantum Computing_. I am currently learning about Quantum Computing and Algorithms and their Applications. I would love to collaborate on developing Quantum Algorithms for Applications in Theoretical Sciences.

## Projects

I have worked on numerous projects across various domains. Here are a few highlights:

- **Computer Vision:** [Project Title](link) - Brief description of the project.
- **NLP:** [Project Title](link) - Brief description of the project.
- **Quantum Computing:** [Project Title](link) - Brief description of the project.

## Research Goals

I'm driven by the quest for knowledge and innovation. My current focus is on advancing my expertise in Physics and Quantum Computing. I actively push codes and repositories on GitHub with the aim of publishing articles in renowned journals like *Nature*. My long-term goal is to pursue a PhD at leading institutions such as MIT, Stanford, CMU, Princeton, CalTech, or UCLA.

## Hobbies

Beyond academics and research, I have a keen interest in:

- Reading books on Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, Economics, and Polity
- Delving into Nobel Prize-winning research in Physics and Fields Medal-winning work in Mathematics
- Engaging in discussions about Olympiad Questions and Competitions like Putnam, INMO, IMO, IPhO
